How to install + run

In your Xcode project, pull from master.

Open terminal (Command + Space, then search for "terminal").

cd into the same directory as where your code for DatePicker is stored.

For example, if my code is on the Desktop, then I'll need to use cd Desktop/Cheers.

Install CocoaPods using the following commands:

sudo gem install cocoapods

pod setup <-- this is a big file, it may take a few minutes

pod install

Wait for the installation to finish, then quit Xcode.

Open DatePicker in Finder. In your DatePicker folder double click on the white .xcworkspace file to open the project (you'll have to use white icon from now on).

Command + R to build and run or press play button on the top left corner. Make sure you either connect your phone to Xcode or choose one of the simulator devices.
