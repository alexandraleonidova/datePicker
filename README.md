## Getting Started

In your Xcode project, pull from `master`'.

Open terminal (`Command + Space`, then search for "terminal").

`cd` into the same directory as where your code for DatePicker is stored.

Install `CocoaPods` using the following commands:

`sudo gem install cocoapods`

`pod setup`

`pod install`

Wait for the installation to finish (might take several minutes), then quit Xcode.

Open DatePicker in Finder. In your DatePicker folder double click on the white `.xcworkspace` file to open the project (you'll have to use white icon from now on).

`Command + R` to build and run or press play button on the top left corner. Make sure you either connect your phone to Xcode or choose one of the simulator devices.
